This script attempts to apply the PyLD "compact" call to the JSON-LD generated by rdf-toolkit.  The issue this script resolves is somewhat cosmetic: rdf-toolkit emits a top-level array of dictionaries, and creates a context dictionary for each dictionary that is a direct child of that array.

This script requires adherence to the JSON-LD requirement that terms not be empty strings.  This includes the blank context prefix permitted in Turtle, and permitted in JSON-LD by some parsers.
